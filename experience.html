                            The company discovered a lot of time consumption was spent on completing repetitive and tedious tasks, 
                            where the current software product was unable to automate them. I acted as a liason between the developers
                            implementing the required changes, while working on my own custom solution.

                            <li>Redesigned database from Bucket Pattern to documents with MongoDB.</li>
                            <li>Optimized database performance vastly by utilizing Indexes.</li>
                            <li>Implemented functional prototype as an interface to setup automated data flows.</li>

                            I learned how to gather domain knowledge and modelling a database around it. 
                            The implementation of a functional prototype gave me the skillset to develop a fullstack project,
                            enabling me to handle both frontend and backend problems. Furthermore, I improved my ability to
                            explain tech heavy concepts to non-technical people.

                            A startup company with an ambition to automate administrative processes for social media.
                            The starting point would be to automate "Yes, please" offers on Facebook, then storing 
                            the data and gain a deeper understanding of how to expand. I was responsible for developing
                            the backend of the Minimal Viable Product.

                            <li>Normalization of the Microsoft SQL Server database.</li>
                            <li>Performed automated tests by implementing Unit and Integration tests.</li>

                            Signing up to work for a startup company means a lot of extra hours, which resulted in me gaining a lot 
                            of new knowledge in the industry. I learned about prioritizing tasks based on whats most critical for the product,
                            how to integrate Facebook with token authentication and OAuth2, while developing a REST API 
                            resulting in becoming an overall better developer.

                            The <span style="font-style: italic">Software Development</span> education builds upon the previous education.
                            The goal is to transition from a programmer who knows how to code, to a developer who knows also knows why. 
                            I chose this education because I am curious about many aspects of software development, where this gave me the 
                            fundamental understanding of the 'why' aspect.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>System Integration</strong> included theory on how to integrate legacy and modern systems.</li>
                            <li><strong>Large Scale Systems</strong> taught me to handle scaling issues before they happen, saving resources.</li>
                            <li><strong>Database for Developers</strong> gained insight on how to handle performance issues and complex queries.</li>
                            <li><strong>Test</strong> gave me knowledge on different testing techniques and how to discover new tests.</li>
                            <li><strong>Electives</strong> provided a fundamental understanding of Programming Language, Security Issues and Machine Learning.</li>

                            The <span style="font-style: italic;">Computer Science</span> education provided the fundamental building blocks. 
                            This is not only limited to programming, but also technology, system development, design patterns, 
                            data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, databases and other concepts. <br>
                            <br>
                            I chose Web Development as the Elective on 4th semester, 
                            because I already gained backend knowledge from the previous semesters and dream of becoming a Fullstack Developer.
